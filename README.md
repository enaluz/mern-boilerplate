# MERN Stack Boilerplate
This is a boilerplate for the MERN stack. The React side is based on Create React App, with a few structural tweaks. 
The backend has some basic packages for Node installed, including Express (of course), and Mongoose.
The root has some dev dependencies and configuration files for things like `prettier` and `eslint`.

## To Run Frontend
`cd` into `/client` and execute `yarn start` in command prompt.

## To Run Backend
`cd` into `/server` and execute `yarn start` in command prompt.

## To Run Entire App
Execute `yarn dev` in command prompt.

## To Install Package For Entire App
Execute `yarn setup` in command prompt.
